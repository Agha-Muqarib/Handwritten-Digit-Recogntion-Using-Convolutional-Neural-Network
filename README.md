# Handwritten-Digit-Recogntion-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This repository contains 2 different models, one on MNIST database and the other at a self generated database, both used to recognize handwritten mathematical digits using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). It involves,

- Collection of digits/images 
- Using that images to create data 
- Using that data to create model 
- Using that model to predict new digits.
